                <p><strong>Starship</strong> is a two-stage, fully reusable, <em>super heavy-lift</em> launch vehicle
                    under development by American aerospace company <mark>SpaceX</mark>. Currently built and launched
                    from Starbase in Texas, it is intended as the successor to the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy
                    rockets,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                    and is part of SpaceX's broader reusable launch system development program.
                    If completed as designed, Starship would be the first fully reusable orbital rocket and have the
                    highest payload capacity of any launch vehicle to date. As of October 13, 2025, Starship has
                    launched 11 times, with 6 successful flights and 5 failures.
                </p>

                <p>The vehicle consists of two stages: the <strong>Super Heavy</strong> booster and the
                    <strong>Starship</strong> spacecraft, both powered by Raptor engines burning liquid methane (the
                    main component of natural gas) and liquid oxygen. Both stages are intended to return to the launch
                    site and land vertically at the launch tower for potential reuse. Once in space, the Starship upper
                    stage is intended to function as a standalone spacecraft capable of carrying crew and cargo.
                    Missions beyond low Earth orbit would require multiple in-orbit refueling flights. At the end of its
                    mission, Starship reenters the atmosphere using heat shield tiles similar to those of the Space
                    Shuttle. SpaceX states that its goal is to reduce launch costs by both reusing and mass producing
                    both stages.
                </p>

                <p>SpaceX has proposed a wide range of missions for Starship, such as deploying large satellites, space
                    station modules, and space telescopes. A crewed variant, developed under contract with NASA, is
                    called
                    the Starship Human Landing System, which is scheduled to deliver astronauts to the Moon as part of
                    the
                    Artemis program, beginning with Artemis III currently scheduled for 2027. SpaceX has also expressed
                    ambitions to use Starship for crewed missions to Mars.</p>

                <p tabindex="0">SpaceX began developing concepts for a super heavy-lift reusable launch vehicle as early
                    as 2005, with different names throughout the years. Starship's current design and name were
                    introduced in 2018. Development has followed an iterative and incremental approach, involving a high
                    number of test flights and prototype vehicles. The first launch of a full Starship vehicle occurred
                    on April 20, 2023, and ended with the explosion of the rocket four minutes after liftoff. The
                    program
                    has failed to meet many of its optimistic schedule goals, with its development having had several
                    setbacks, including the failure of the first four Block 2 upper stages in 2025.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When stacked and fully fueled, Starship has a mass of approximately 5,300 t (11,700,000
                    lb),<sup>[b]</sup> a diameter of 9 m (30 ft) and a height of 121.3 m (398 ft). The rocket has been
                    designed with the goal of being fully reusable to reduce
                    launch costs; it consists of the Super Heavy booster and the Starship upper
                    stage which are powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines.</p>

                <p>The bodies of both rocket stages are made from stainless steel and are manufactured by
                    stacking and welding stainless steel cylinders. These cylinders have a height of 1.83
                    m (6 ft), and a thickness of 3.97 mm (0.156 in).</p>

                <p>Domes inside the spacecraft separate the methane and oxygen tanks. SpaceX has stated
                    that Starship, in its "baseline reusable design", will have a payload capacity of 100–150 t
                    (220,000–331,000 lb) to low Earth orbit and 27 t (60,000 lb) to geostationary transfer
                    orbit.</p>

                <p>Super Heavy is 71 m (233 ft) tall (in its Block 1 and Block 2 design, now retired), 9 m (30 ft)
                    wide, and is composed of four general sections: the engines, the oxygen tank, the fuel tank, and the
